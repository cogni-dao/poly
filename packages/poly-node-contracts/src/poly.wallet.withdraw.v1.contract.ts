/**
 * Module: `@contracts/poly.wallet.withdraw.v1.contract`
 * Purpose: Contract for withdrawing funds from the calling user's
 *   tenant-scoped Polymarket trading wallet.
 * Scope: POST /api/v1/poly/wallet/withdraw. Schema-only. TENANT_SCOPED
 *   (session auth). The server derives the source wallet from the session's
 *   billing account; the body can only choose a pinned asset, destination, and
 *   amount.
 * Invariants: NO_GENERIC_SIGNING; IRREVERSIBLE_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED; typed
 *   assets only (`usdc_e`, `pusd`, `pol`). pUSD withdrawal unwraps pUSD through
 *   Polymarket CollateralOfframp and delivers USDC.e.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/spec/poly-tenant-and-collateral.md,
 *        nodes/poly/app/src/app/api/v1/poly/wallet/withdraw/route.ts,
 *        https://docs.polymarket.com/concepts/pusd,
