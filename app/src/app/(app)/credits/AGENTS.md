## Purpose

Protected Money page (served from the `/credits` route — URL is stable; the page is relabelled, not renamed). Composes two panels:

- `AiCreditsPanel` — AI credits balance + USDC top-up flow (unchanged behaviour from the single-column credits page).
- `TradingWalletPanel` — per-tenant Polymarket trading-wallet lifecycle. When disconnected, renders `TradingWalletConnectFlow` inline (first-time wallet provisioning via `/api/v1/poly/wallet/connect`); when connected, shows USDC.e + POL balances from `/api/v1/poly/wallet/status` + `/api/v1/poly/wallet/balances`, the Enable Trading CTA (`TradingReadinessSection`, task.0355), auto-wrap consent, the withdraw dialog, and a stubbed fund button linked to [task.0352](../../../../../../work/items/task.0352.poly-trading-wallet-fund-flow.md).
- `TradingWalletWithdrawDialog` — two-step withdrawal UI for USDC.e transfer, pUSD unwrap to USDC.e, or native POL transfer via `/api/v1/poly/wallet/withdraw`. Destination is pasted and re-entered in v0; SIWE-wallet defaulting is future work.
- `TradingWalletConnectFlow` — the per-tenant create-wallet UI (caps sliders + custodial-consent CTA). Moved here from `/profile` in task.0361 so wallet creation, funding, and approvals all live on one page.

Desktop renders both panels as a two-column grid; mobile uses an **AI Credits** / **Trading wallet** pill toggle above a single-column stack.

When approvals are signed but USDC.e=0, `TradingReadinessSection` recolors the compact "Trading enabled" pill from green to warning/yellow (FUNDED_RECOLOR, task.0365) — same shape, one-line tone-shift, no extra hero copy.

## Pointers

- [Root AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md)
- [App AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- [Repo-spec helper](../../../shared/config/repoSpec.server.ts)
- [Credits page client](./CreditsPage.client.tsx)

## Boundaries

```json
{
  "layer": "app",
  "may_import": [
    "app",
    "features",
    "ports",

}
```

## Public Surface

- **Exports:** none
- **Route:** `/credits` (server page + client composition; label in nav is "Money", Lucide `Coins` icon)
- **Files considered API:** `page.tsx`, `CreditsPage.client.tsx`, `AiCreditsPanel.tsx`, `TradingWalletPanel.tsx`, `TradingWalletConnectFlow.tsx`, `TradingWalletWithdrawDialog.tsx`, `TradingReadinessSection.tsx`

## Responsibilities

- **Does:** Fetch widget config server-side via `@/shared/config` (repo-spec), render the Money page shell, compose `AiCreditsPanel` (payments) + `TradingWalletPanel` (poly wallet) as a responsive two-column grid with a mobile toggle.
- **Does not:** Read env vars or repo-spec on the client; hardcode source wallets or chain IDs; perform trading-wallet fund writes (task.0352).

## Usage

- Server page calls `getPaymentConfig()` and passes props to `CreditsPageClient`.
- Client component renders payment UI with provided chainId/receivingAddress and calls confirm endpoint on success.

## Standards

- Payment configuration must come from repo-spec via `getPaymentConfig()`; no env overrides or client-side file reads.

## Dependencies

- **Internal:** `@/shared/config`, `@/components/vendor/depay`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `@/components/kit/wallet` (AddressChip).
- **External:** none

## Change Protocol

- Update this file when route shape or config source changes.
- Keep widget config sourced from repo-spec; adjust boundaries if imports change.

## Notes

- Changing wallet/chain/provider requires editing `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` and redeploying; no env overrides.
- Client code must treat widget configuration as props only.
