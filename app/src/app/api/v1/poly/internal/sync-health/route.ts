/**
 * Module: `@app/api/v1/poly/internal/sync-health`
 * Purpose: HTTP GET — aggregate sync-freshness stats for the order reconciler. Suitable for a Grafana alert rule and a dashboard freshness banner.
 * Scope: No auth — aggregate-only, no PII, no wallet addresses.
 * Invariants:
 *   - SYNC_HEALTH_IS_PUBLIC — response is Zod-validated against PolySyncHealthResponseSchema before returning.
 *   - No user scoping — this endpoint is internal metrics only.
 *   - NO_AUTH_INTENTIONAL — this route intentionally has no authentication. It returns aggregate-only
 *     stats (counts + timestamps), no PII or wallet addresses. Auth was reviewed and deferred
 *     (task.0328 rev1 — follow-up slice may add internal token if threat model changes).
 * Side-effects: IO (one DB SELECT via service-role client + in-process clock read).
 * Notes: reconciler_last_tick_at is null when the reconciler is not running (Polymarket creds absent) or has not completed a tick yet.
 *   This node does not wire the order-reconciler handle into the container, so
 *   `reconciler_last_tick_at` is always null here (reconciler not running).
 * Links: work/items/task.0328.md, docs/spec/poly-copy-trade-execution.md
 * @public
