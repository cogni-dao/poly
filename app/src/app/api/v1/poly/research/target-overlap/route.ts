/**
 * Module: `@app/api/v1/poly/research/target-overlap`
 * Purpose: HTTP GET — RN1/swisstony shared-vs-solo active-market overlap.
 * Scope: Thin route. Validates query/output with the poly research overlap
 * contract and delegates aggregation to the wallet-analysis feature service.
 * Invariants:
 *   - AUTH_REQUIRED: research surface is protected.
 *   - SAVED_FACTS_ONLY: reads Postgres observed trader facts; no live upstream
 *     Polymarket calls on page load.
 * Side-effects: DB reads only.
 * Links: docs/spec/poly-copy-trade-execution.md, work/items/task.5005
