/**
 * Module: `@bootstrap/capabilities/finance`
 * Purpose: Hand the app layer this node's finance data seams without exposing adapters: the credited-purchases query
 *   behind the package income reader.
 * Scope: Composition only. The money-plane composition itself stays in the page's server helper.
 * Invariants: Service-role read (payment_attempts is RLS-protected; income is node-wide). Never throws at construction:
 *   a missing database yields null and the row reads UNKNOWN.
 * Side-effects: Opens the service database client on first use.
 * Links: src/adapters/server/finance/credit-purchase-income.query.ts, @cogni/money-plane creditPurchaseIncomeReader
